This is a brief description/example of how our program regulates the step value.
================================================================================

NOTE: Our program works under the assumption that both upload and download speeds 
are symmetric.

Let's take the following example: PC1 and PC2 are in different networks with a 
bandwidth of 300/300 kbps and 500/500 kbps respectively. The audio that each 
client is transmitting has a bitrate of 1000 kbps.

       PC1         PC1 will still receive 300         PC2
    +-------+         <-------------------         +-------+
    |       |                                      |       |
    |       |                                      |       |
    +-------+         ------------------->         +-------+
     300/300        PC2 will only receive 300       500/500

Our program, running in PC1, will see that the client is receiving 300 kbps and sending 
1000 kbps and therefore will adjust the step value since it believes that the
network is limited to 300/300. Even though PC2 is also sending at 1000 kbps (initially),
PC1 will still receive 300 kbps (again we are limited by the network).

PC2 will see that the audio being sent is not equal to the audio that is being received
(even though the network is better 500 > 300, it will still receive 300 kbps) and adjust
the step value accordingly. Taking into account that the higher the step value, the higher
the chance of compressing the data at a higher rate, we have to use the following formula:

    self.step_level * self.sent_kbps / self.received_kbps

This means that the rate at which the data is being sent (and received) will be limited
by the slowest client out of the two (PC1 in this example).

It's important to note that since both clients might be sending different data (at different
bitrates) and using different step values, we must include the step value alongside the
chunk number and the audio itself (that way the the recipient can decode the audio correctly).
