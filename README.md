# intercom

A simple low-latency full-duplex intercom. Two or more intercom users will be able (the project is still unfinished) to communicate (audio and video) in real-time (with a minimal latency) using a _room_ defined in a public server. All communications are Peer-to-Peer (P2P).

## Platform

The software is written in Python 3, and therefore, you should be able to run it in any machine where a Python's interpreter is available.
